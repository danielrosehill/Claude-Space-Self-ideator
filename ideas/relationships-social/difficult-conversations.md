# Difficult Conversations

## Use Case

Prepare for challenging conversations with structured thinking, perspective-taking, and outcome planning. Move from anxiety about hard conversations to systematic preparation that increases chances of positive outcomes.

## Execution Difficulty

**Level**: Easy

**Rationale**: Each conversation is relatively self-contained. The value comes from the structured preparation process, not complex multi-session workflows.

## Suggested Folder Structure

```
├── conversations/
│   └── [conversation-id]/
│       ├── situation.md         # What needs discussing
│       ├── their-perspective.md # Understanding their view
│       ├── my-goals.md          # What I want to achieve
│       ├── talking-points.md    # Key points to make
│       └── outcome.md           # How it went
├── frameworks/
│   └── techniques.md            # Conversation frameworks
└── outputs/
    └── lessons/                 # Patterns from past conversations
```

## Key Workflows

- Structure a difficult conversation with clear goals and talking points
- Perspective-shift exercise to understand the other person's viewpoint
- Anticipate objections and prepare responses
- Post-conversation debrief to capture lessons
- Pattern analysis across past difficult conversations

## Suggested Slash Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/prepare-conversation` | Full preparation walkthrough for upcoming conversation |
| `/perspective-shift` | Exercise to see situation from other person's view |
| `/debrief` | Post-conversation analysis and lesson capture |

## Suggested Agents

None required - the structured prompting in commands is sufficient.

## Why This Works as a Claude Space

- Preparation reduces anxiety and improves outcomes
- Past conversations become learning material
- Private and sensitive - must stay local
