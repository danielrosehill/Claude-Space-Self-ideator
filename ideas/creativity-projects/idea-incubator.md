# Idea Incubator

## Use Case

Capture, develop, and cross-pollinate ideas across domains. Not just idea storage but active idea development - taking raw sparks and nurturing them into developed concepts through iteration and unexpected combinations.

## Execution Difficulty

**Level**: Easy

**Rationale**: Simple capture and development structure. The magic is in accumulation and combination over time.

## Suggested Folder Structure

```
├── inbox/                       # Raw idea capture
├── ideas/
│   └── [idea-id]/
│       ├── seed.md              # Original idea
│       └── development/         # Iteration notes
├── combinations/                # Forced combinations
└── outputs/
    ├── refined/                 # Developed concepts
    └── archived/                # Ideas not pursued (with reasons)
```

## Key Workflows

- Quick capture of raw ideas without judgment
- Develop promising ideas through structured iteration
- Force random combinations of unrelated ideas
- Cross-pollinate ideas from different domains
- Periodic audit to develop, combine, or archive

## Suggested Slash Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/capture` | Quick-add raw idea to inbox |
| `/develop` | Structured development of a specific idea |
| `/random-combine` | Force combination of two random ideas |
| `/idea-audit` | Review inbox and decide: develop, combine, or archive |

## Suggested Agents

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `idea-challenger` | Stress-tests ideas, finds weaknesses, suggests pivots |

## Why This Works as a Claude Space

- Ideas compound over time through combination
- Development history shows how concepts evolved
- Archive preserves "failed" ideas for future recombination
