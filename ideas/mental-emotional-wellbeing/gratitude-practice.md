# Gratitude Practice

## Use Case

Structured gratitude practice with variety, depth, and pattern recognition. Move beyond rote "three things I'm grateful for" to a rich, evolving practice that reveals what actually matters to you.

## Execution Difficulty

**Level**: Easy

**Rationale**: Simple daily logging with optional deeper exploration. Low barrier to entry.

## Suggested Folder Structure

```
├── daily/
│   └── [YYYY-MM]/               # Daily entries
├── categories/
│   ├── people/
│   ├── experiences/
│   └── growth/
├── deep-dives/
│   └── [topic]/                 # In-depth explorations
└── outputs/
    ├── patterns/                # What appears most often
    └── letters/                 # Gratitude letters to send
```

## Key Workflows

- Daily gratitude capture with categorization
- Periodic deep-dive on specific gratitude topics
- Pattern analysis: what do you appreciate most?
- Gratitude letter writing for sharing appreciation
- Monthly/quarterly gratitude summaries

## Suggested Slash Commands

| Command | Purpose |

| `/daily-gratitude` | Quick daily gratitude entry |
| `/deep-gratitude` | Extended exploration of one gratitude topic |

| `/monthly-review` | Summary of gratitude patterns |

## Suggested Agents

None required - simple practice that works well with direct interaction.

## Why This Works as a Claude Space

- Gratitude patterns emerge over time
- Historical entries become meaningful artifacts
- Variety prompts prevent staleness
