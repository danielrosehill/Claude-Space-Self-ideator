# Emergency Preparedness

## Use Case

Household emergency preparedness - supplies inventory, emergency plans, contact lists, and scenario planning. Transform vague anxiety about "being prepared" into concrete readiness with maintained supplies and practiced plans.

## Execution Difficulty

**Level**: Easy

**Rationale**: Initial setup requires thought, but ongoing maintenance is periodic and straightforward.

├── supplies/
│   ├── inventory.md             # What you have
│   ├── rotation.md              # Items needing rotation
│   └── gaps.md                  # What you need
├── plans/
│   ├── evacuation/              # Evacuation routes
│   ├── shelter-in-place/        # Shelter procedures
